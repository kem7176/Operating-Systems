Operating Systems Functions


Starting a Computer 
In order to excecute this operation, you need to press the power button. 
What this does is it allows a power supply a current to the circuits of the computer.
As the computer is booting, internal processes are taking place to make sure everything is functioning properly,
if not, an error message may be displayed.
If a successful boot up occurs, your UI will display on the page and you're ready to go!


User Interface
The UI allows you to control how you enter data, instructions and how information is displayed on the page.
There are two types of interface, Graphical User Interface, and Command-Line Interface.

Graphical User Interface (GUI).
GUI is the face of the OS. It is what you interact with on the screen, allowing you to perform many functions including
touching, pointing, and tapping. 

Command-Line Interface
Command-Line Interface allows the user to go "behind-the-scenes" and use a command language to execute functions with 
short keywords or abbreviations. 
This is used to configure the computer and among others, troubleshoot system problems.
